# Cabaret 25 Flight Plan

These are the files for the cabaret 25 table print outs.

## Project Files

- **flightPlanA3.pdf**: The first print file created for the project
- **print-a3.html**: HTML version for printing
- **flightPlan.sv**: SVG source file
- **flightPlan-nobg.svg**: SVG version without background
- **title.png**: Title image
- **roadmapInspo.webp**: Inspiration image for the SVG design
- **Gemini_Generated_Image_*.jpeg/png**: Background images generated by Google Gemini

## Prompts

### Background Image Prompt
I gave this as the prompt:
> Can you generate an image for a background which has galaxies, nebulae, some huge rusty spaceships, some small cool ones, and a few monsters - you can be inspired by the names of these planets - 
> 
> Klingon Carpark
> Mount Olympus
> Bowie zone
> Doge hq shower
> Planet cyclops
> Hades
> Planet dad
> Planet donkey
> Siren solar system
> Deep space
> Ship of junk
> Planet Circe
> Planet Calypso
> The moon
> Planet Dangar

### SVG Flight Plan Prompt
The SVG prompt (also generated by Claude):
> Create for me an SVG which is a vibrant and creative cosmic journey roadmap poster the design features:
>
> Visual Elements:
> -  background is the attached image, but slightly muted into the background
> - An animated spaceship with glowing thrusters at the starting point
> - Each planet has unique colors and visual effects that match their names
>

## Inspiration Sources

The file `roadmapInspo.webp` was used as inspiration for the model when generating the SVG flight plan. This image was referenced in the SVG prompt as "the attached image" that would be used as a muted background in the design.

## Models Used

The following AI models were used in the creation of these files:

- **Google Gemini**: Used for background image generation
- **Claude Sonnet**: Used for SVG generation
